<h3>Project Information</h3>
<p>This website presents preliminary data on U.S. National Parks that are part of the Central Grassland Initiative. Parks were selected based on their location entirely within the Central Grasslands Roadmap boundary (see source information below). Data sources included in this dashboard include: 
<ul>
<li><a href = "https://www.grasslandsroadmap.org/mapping">Central Grasslands Roadmap Assessment Map</a></li> 
<li>Administrative boundaries of NPS units downloaded 7/24/2025: <a href = "https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2314463">IRMA Record 2314463</a></li> 
<li>Park visitation data for 2024: <a href = "https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Query%20Builder%20for%20Public%20Use%20Statistics%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)">NPS Visitation Query Builder</a></li>
</ul>

Data were compiled by Kate Miller in July 2024. All code can be accessed on the following GitHub repository: <a href = "https://github.com/katemmiller/centralGrasslands/">katemmiller/centralGrasslands</a>
